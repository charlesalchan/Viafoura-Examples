Here you will find a collection of various samples showing integration with the Viafoura platform.

# iOS and Android Full Mobile SDK
Some clients have a "Mobile-First" Approach to their strategies and as such prefer to have viafoura as a native application (as opposed to the webview rendered version). Understanding this need, we have a full SDK for both iOS and Android available for our clients. Please contact us, and we will provide you with our AMAZING SDK.

# Mobile Webview Integration 
Viafoura social plugins work out of the box in any mobile environment as it is responsive by default. Some clients prefer to load the viafoura social plugins in a webview inside an app. To do this, some considerations need to be made for the login flow, and we have provided example apps that show a working example of this for both iOS (https://github.com/viafoura/Viafoura-Examples/tree/master/iOS-Login-UIWebView-Example-App) and Android (https://github.com/viafoura/Viafoura-Examples/tree/master/Android-Login-WebView-Example-App). 

# Cookie Login Integration
Some clients have their own login (i.e. Authentication) systems and would like to integrate that with viafoura. This example code (https://github.com/viafoura/Viafoura-Examples/tree/master/cookie-login) provides a working example of a how an endpoint to verify a cookie (for the purpose of Authentication) can look like.
